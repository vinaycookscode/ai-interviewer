We needed to handle 10x traffic growth and the existing architecture couldn't scale. I designed a new architecture using [technology], which required [interesting challenge]. I led the migration over 3 months with zero downtime. The result was 99.99% uptime and 50% cost reduction. I learned a lot about [Y] and it's now a template for other teams.\"\n\n**Be ready for follow-ups:** Technical deep-dives, what you'd do differently" },
    { front: "How do you handle ambiguity or unclear requirements?", back: "**Framework (CLARIFY):**\n\n**C - Clarify:** Ask questions to understand the goal\n- \"What problem are we solving?\"\n- \"Who is the user?\"\n- \"What does success look like?\"\n\n**L - List assumptions:** Document what you're assuming\n\n**A - Align:** Share assumptions with stakeholders\n\n**R - Reduce scope:** Start with MVP\n\n**I - Iterate:** Get feedback early and often\n\n**F - Flexible:** Adapt as you learn more\n\n**Example answer:**\n\"When I face ambiguity, I first try to understand the core goal by asking questions. In my last project, requirements were vague, so I listed 10 assumptions, validated them with the PM, and proposed a phased approach. We shipped a basic version in 2 weeks, got user feedback, and iterated. The final product was different from initial ideas but solved the real problem.\"\n\n**They want to see:** Proactive, not paralyzed by ambiguity." },

Dev satisfaction improved (survey showed +25%). Other teams adopted our process.\"\n\n**Key:** Quantify both the problem AND the improvement." },
    { front: "How do you prioritize your work?", back: "**Framework:**\n\n**1. Understand urgency vs importance:**\n- Urgent + Important: Do first\n- Important not urgent: Schedule\n- Urgent not important: Delegate/quick\n- Neither: Eliminate\n\n**2. Consider impact:**\n- Revenue impact\n- User impact\n- Team unblocking\n\n**3. Communicate:**\n- Discuss priorities with manager\n- Push back if overloaded\n- Renegotiate deadlines if needed\n\n**Example answer:**\n\"I start each week by listing tasks and categorizing by impact and urgency. I check with my manager to align priorities. For daily work, I tackle high-impact items when I have most energy (mornings). I block focus time for deep work and batch meetings. When priorities conflict, I communicate trade-offs to stakeholders rather than just accepting everything.\"" },
    { front: "Describe a situation where you had to persuade someone.", back: "**Shows:** Communication, influence, ability to drive alignment\n\n**STAR Example:**\n\n**Situation:** \"Our team wanted to rewrite a legacy system in a new framework, but the VP was skeptical...\"\n\n**Task:** \"I needed to convince leadership to approve the project.\"\n\n**Action:**\n1. \"Gathered data: current maintenance costs, outage frequency, developer velocity\"\n2. \"Created a comparison document: status quo vs rewrite\"\n3. \"Identified VP's concerns: risk, timeline, resources\"\n4. \"Proposed a phased approach to reduce risk\"\n5. \"Got buy-in from other senior engineers first\"\n\n**Result:** \"VP approved Phase 1. We delivered on time, proving the concept. Full rewrite was approved. System downtime reduced 80%.\"\n\n**Key:** Understand their concerns, use data, build consensus." },
    { front: "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond.", back: "**Shows:** Initiative, dedication, going the extra mile\n\n**STAR Example:**\n\n**Situation:** \"We had a production incident on a Friday evening that was affecting 10% of users...\"\n\n**Task:** \"I wasn't on-call, but I saw the alert and the on-call engineer was struggling.\"\n\n**Action:**\n1. \"Joined the war room to help debug\"\n2. \"Found a workaround within an hour\"\n3. \"Stayed to implement the proper fix\"\n4. \"Wrote documentation to prevent recurrence\"\n5. \"Monday: led a post-mortem and action items\"\n\n**Result:** \"Issue was resolved in 3 hours instead of potential 12+. Users were minimally impacted. We added monitoring that caught 2 similar issues before users noticed.\"\n\n**Balance:** Show you can go above and beyond without burning out. Mention sustainable practices too." },
    { front: "What motivates you at work?", back: "**Be authentic but relevant to the role:**\n\n**Good motivations:**\n- Solving challenging technical problems\n- Learning and growth\n- Impact on users\n- Collaboration with talented people\n- Building products people love\n- Mentoring others\n\n**Structure:**\n\"I'm motivated by [motivation]. For example, [specific story]. That's why I'm excited about [company] because [connection].\"\n\n**Example:**\n\"I'm most motivated when I can see direct impact on users. At my last company, I worked on a feature that reduced customer support tickets by 40%. Seeing that data and hearing positive feedback from users was incredibly rewarding. I'm excited about [company] because your product directly affects [users] and I'd love to contribute to that.\"\n\n**Avoid:**\n❌ Only saying \"money\" (even if true)\n❌ Vague answers (\"I like coding\")\n❌ Things this role doesn't offer" },
    { front: "Tell me about a time you dealt with an unhappy customer/stakeholder.", back: "**Shows:** Communication, empathy, problem-solving\n\n**STAR Example:**\n\n**Situation:** \"An internal team was frustrated because our API was slow and they'd complained multiple times without resolution...\"\n\n**Task:** \"I was assigned to investigate and improve the relationship.\"\n\n**Action:**\n1. \"Met with them to understand specific pain points\"\n2. \"Apologized for past poor communication\"\n3. \"Identified 3 quick wins and 2 larger fixes\"\n4. \"Delivered first improvement within a week\"\n5. \"Set up weekly sync until issues were resolved\"\n6. \"Created a feedback channel for ongoing communication\"\n\n**Result:** \"Resolved main issues in 3 weeks. Relationship improved significantly. They became advocates for our team. Process we created is now used for all internal stakeholder management.\"\n\n**Key:** Empathy, action, follow-through." },
    { front: "How do you handle working with difficult people?", back: "**Reframe \"difficult\" as \"different\":**\n\n**Framework:**\n\n**1.

Adapt:** Adjust your approach\n- More data-driven?\n- More frequent check-ins?\n- Different communication channel?\n\n**3. Direct conversation:** Address issues privately\n- Focus on behavior, not personality\n- Use \"I\" statements\n\n**4. Escalate if needed:** Involve manager as last resort\n\n**Example:**\n\"I worked with a colleague who seemed to dismiss my ideas in meetings. Instead of getting frustrated, I had a 1:1 coffee chat. I learned they were overwhelmed and felt defensive in groups. We agreed to share ideas async first. Our collaboration improved significantly and we delivered a successful project together.\"\n\n**Never:** Bad-mouth previous colleagues." },
    { front: "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?", back: "**Show ambition aligned with realistic progression:**\n\n**Structure:**\n\"In 5 years, I'd like to [goal] by [how]. I see this role as [connection to that path].\"\n\n**Examples by level:**\n\n**For IC path:**\n\"I want to become a technical leader who designs systems that scale and mentors junior engineers. I see this role as an opportunity to deepen my expertise in [domain] and take on more technical leadership.\"\n\n**For management path:**\n\"I'm interested in eventually leading engineering teams. I want to first be a strong individual contributor and tech lead, then potentially move into management. I value companies where both paths are supported.\"\n\n**Tips:**\n- Be specific but flexible\n- Connect to the role/company\n- Show you've thought about growth\n\n**Avoid:**\n❌ \"Your job\" (awkward)\n❌ \"I don't know\" (shows no planning)\n❌ Completely unrealistic goals" },
